### GitHub Actions + EC2 (Automated Deployment)

This project includes an automated deployment workflow using GitHub Actions. When you push to the main branch, it will:

1. **Build the project** - Runs linting and builds the project
2. **Test the build** - If build fails, the deployment is rejected
3. **Deploy to EC2** - If build succeeds, automatically deploys to your EC2 instance

#### Setup Instructions:

1. **Add GitHub Secrets** (in your GitHub repository settings):
   - `EC2_HOST`: Your EC2 instance public IP or domain
   - `EC2_USERNAME`: SSH username (usually `ubuntu` or `ec2-user`)
   - `EC2_SSH_KEY`: Your private SSH key for EC2 access
   - `EC2_PORT`: SSH port (usually `22`)

2. **EC2 Setup Requirements**:
   - Node.js and npm installed
   - PM2 installed globally: `npm install -g pm2`
   - Your portfolio repository cloned to `/home/username/Portfolio`
   - PM2 process named "portfolio" configured

3. **PM2 Configuration** (on your EC2 instance):
   ```bash
   cd Portfolio
   pm2 start npm --name "portfolio" -- start
   pm2 save
   pm2 startup
   ```

4. **Workflow Behavior**:
   - **On Push to main/master**: Triggers build and deployment
   - **On Pull Request**: Only runs build (no deployment)
   - **Build Failure**: Stops deployment and shows error
   - **Build Success**: Automatically deploys to EC2

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
